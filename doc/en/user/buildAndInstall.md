# Get started
A simple process can be depicted below:

1. First, you need clone or download the repository. And enter the root directory of the repository. 
2. Use `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to configure `cmake`.
3. Enter the directory after argument `-B`, in this example it is `build`.
4. Use `cmake --build . -j8` to compile the project. The `-j8` means compiling with `8` threads, and
this has nothing to do with the number of threads when calculating, you can change the number if you
like.
5. Use `cmake --install . --prefix /usr` to install the library to `/usr`, you can change the
argument after `--prefix` to specify where you want to install the library.

Note that if you install the library to a directory which is not a shared library search directory,
you may need update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to let the linker find the library when running it. Or you can
build `mca` as a static library by adding `-Dmca_BUILD_SHARE_LIB=off` when configuring `cmake`.
