# matrix-calculation-accelerator
## Brief Introduction
Matrix calculation implemented by C++ with multi-thread.  This will implement some basic
calculations of matrices, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.

## What Can You Learn From This
Those below are what you can learn:
* The basic usages of `git`
* How to write a reasonable and readable commit message
* The whole `gitflow` process
* The basic usage of `cmake`
* The `CI` process
* How to write unit tests with `GoogleTest`
* How to generate code coverage report with `lcov`
* ...
