# matrix-calculation-accelerator

## Brief Introduction
Matrix calculation implemented by C++ with multi-thread.  This will implement some basic
calculations of matrices, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.

## What Can You Learn From This
Those below are what you can learn:
* The basic usages of `git`
* How to write a reasonable and readable commit message
* The whole `gitflow` process
* The basic usage of `cmake`
* The `CI` process
* How to write unit tests with `GoogleTest`
* How to generate code coverage report with `lcov`
* ...

# Release Log
`v0.1.2`:
* This version adds titles of the statistical figures.

`v0.1.1`:
* This version updates the `url` of `codecov`.

`v0.1.0`:
* This version has finished all the needed methods by multi-thread calculation.

`v0.0.3`:
* This version substitutes `multi thread` with `multi-thread`.

`v0.0.2`:
* This version substitutes the `#` with `*`.

`v0.0.1`:
* This version adds a git flow for clang format check.

`v0.0.0`:
* This is the initial commit. We finish `cmake` configure, `googletest` configure, and add
`github workflow`.
